### The U.S. has Gone F&\*%ing Mad

On December 2, 2015, an absolute tragedy occurred. 14 Americans were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a mass shooting in San Bernardino.

Which of the following would you attribute responsibility for what happened:

"Oh but Ellie, if you're that broke, work your way through school." I already did that, you dried up cadaver. I went to USC where I majored in Human Biology and worked the entire time I was in school to pay for my groceries and textbooks since my parents lived paycheck to paycheck. I commuted from home for one and a half years but moved back to school because I realized that I was getting more financial aid when I was in school since I was choosing a cheap place to live, whereas FAFSA assumed I didn't need that much money when I was living with my parents. I got myself a laptop with a credit card that I'm still paying off and I was fully aware I didn't fit in with the culture at USC the entire time I was there but I didn't care. It was hard and it sucked but I did it and I'm unashamed that I had to do it while other people I knew could go on spring breaks to Cancun. I have a shiny degree with my name on it, lots of knowledge about things I'm passionate about, and a whole lot of debt. The thing about financial aid is that they'll give you enough to make your dream a reality, but withhold enough that you have to take the maximum loans an undergraduate student can take (there's a cap each year which increases as you gain seniority, but you wouldn't know that because college cost $5 when you went) and so that your parents have to pay an amount that is just barely out of reach so that they have to resort to the parent PLUS loan but not feel too bad about it. I have 30k in loans and my parents have 20k (which I fully intend to pay myself), and while that may not be too much compared to some folks, you have to remember that it's proportionate to how poor we are and I'm kind of freaking out.
